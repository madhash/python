python
======
It base of this program lies in its merge function which takes a list as arguments and merges it while move function takes the move but in intergers to move the grids up or down or left or right

added two characters 

1)devestator '-' ---> if you slide in any direction and if the devestor is present between the twio numbers then they will be set to zero

2)power star '*' --->  if you slide in any direction and if the power star is present between the twio numbers then they will be set to multiplication of that two number
example) [2,'*',4,0] will be converted to [8,0,0,0]

if both symble if present power star has higher procederence

there are few bug in the code working on it to be fixed and patched up
